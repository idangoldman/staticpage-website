Hello old friend,

**Great News**, StaticPage is in full-time development mode and will be released on May 1st.

I wonâ€™t bore you with the details, you can read all about it in [April Fool's Beginning](https://tinyletter.com/idan_goldman/letters/april-fool-s-beginning) letter sent out last week.

All I will write is that **StaticPage** was updated with new features on and off in the past 2 years and now itâ€™s in full-time development mode. Features like multiple pages, preset templates (release this week), social icons, and more.

~~You can try the new version by subscribing to StaticPage Mailing List and getting a link to test it out.~~

You can try the new version by registering [here](https://app.staticpage.io/register).

Please let me know what are your thoughts about the new version of **StaticPage**!

Follow me on Twitter and get daily updates on the progress of developing StaticPage at [@idan_goldman](https://twitter.com/idan_goldman).

Meanwhile, have fun and enjoy the week! ðŸ¤“ Idan.
