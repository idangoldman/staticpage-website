  "paragraph": "Idan Goldman, a Frontend Developer with 10+ years of experience under my belt. Decided to quit my job and follow the dream of building a product company. What a better way to do so than using my frontend expertise to develop a page builder. One that saves time, easy to use, and most importantly gives you control of the source code. You can follow me and my journey on Twitter at [@idan_goldman](https://twitter.com/idan_goldman) or subscribe to StaticPageâ€™s mailing list and get updated on the latest features and growth."
